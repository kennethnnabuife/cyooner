          We are a limited liability company with RC 1772231 dealing in

          This explains why we are located at the heart and capital hub of
          African Art; Benin City, Nigeria. At Cyooner we believe furniture is
          more than just aesthetics, it is a place where the future is designed
          (school), products are birth(company), negotiations are made
          (Conference rooms) and bonds are created (home).
